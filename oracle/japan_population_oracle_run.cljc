;; One-time measurement oracle for AWAI-2818 (2026-11-12).
;;
;; Run from the repo root:
;;   basilisp run oracle/japan_population_oracle_run.cljc > examples/generated/japan-population-aging-results.edn
;; Also runnable on JVM Clojure or Babashka (top-level forms execute on load).
;; Pure clojure.core only: no host interop, no reader conditionals, no IO
;; inside (stdout carries the EDN; the shell redirects it).
;; Avoid same-name shadowing between loop vars and coefficient bindings
;; (Basilisp misbehaves: see AWAI-2811 notes).
;;
;; NOT part of CI/gate/build/workflow. dynamics CI only runs
;; test/run_tests.cljk via nbb; nothing invokes this file.
;;
;; Parameters mirror examples/japan-population-aging-scenarios.edn (single
;; source of truth). Before running, confirm the mirror holds:
;;   grep -e ':birth-rate 0.005543' -e ':death-rate 0.012968' \
;;        -e ':aging-coef 0.017' -e ':p0 123.802' -e ':e0 36.253' \
;;        -e ':net-migration 0.37' \
